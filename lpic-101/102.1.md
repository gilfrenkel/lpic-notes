# Linux LPIC-1: System Administrator

## Linux installation and Package management

### Hard disk layout and lvm


#### Partitioning options

there are several customization options when installing linux, one of those
are the partitioning and mount points that you can create on your system

##### /boot

contains the bootloader and the initrd and kernel, should be around 500MB-2GiB in size
usually placed in the start of the first disk

##### swap

should be at least the size of your memory + 10%
in case your system crashes the memory will be dumped into your disk,
 there should be enough space on the swap partition to hold all that memory

##### /home

if the system is going to be used by several users that install / edit / save documents
this directory should be on a different partition to make sure
that user saved data wont fill the root partition

##### /

the root filesystem must always have space!

##### /var

database files and logs are saved here by default
both can bloat to sizes that might fill the root partition
therefor i might consider seperating the whole directory to a different partition

##### /opt

if system will have 3rd party apps, they are going to be placed here by default

##### /usr

if alot of application are going to be installed.
this directory is not usually mounted

#### LVM

This explanation is shallow on purpose, 
later in the course it will be more extensivly explained

##### LVM Advantages

* Flexibility - resizing logical volumes, adding physical volumes
* Snapshots - Make 'point in time' backups, mirror them on other disks for migrations, testing, restores amd backups


##### PV (Physical volumes)

Block devices designated for LVM usage, the building blocks of the LVM scheme

##### VG (Volume Group)

Combining physical volumes creates a pool of available storage,
this storage is called a volume group and is made of PE (Physical Extants)
that break up the PVs into units that can be used in a Volume Group

##### LV (Volume Group)

The usable space that gets allocated from a volume group.

can be resized based on the available space in the VG.
