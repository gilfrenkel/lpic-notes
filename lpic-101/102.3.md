### Manage Shared Libraries

#### What are shared libraries

Shared libraries are files containing functions (and other objects)
that applications use during their runtime, Shared Library file names
are typically lib[name].so.[version], and can be located in different directories.

/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/local/lib
/usr/share

##### Static link

A static link is when an application is bundled with
the shared libraries it uses.

Pros:
* The application will always have the correct version of the shared library it needs

Cons:
* The size of the application will increase with the size of it's libraries
* Sometimes butfixes and version bumps will require the application to distribute a new version of the library

##### Dynamic linking

A Dynamic link is when a shared object is loaded to memory
only when a program that runs it is started, after loaded
any application can use the library.

Pros:
* Applications can share a library

Cons:
* Slower then static linking

##### The ldd command
