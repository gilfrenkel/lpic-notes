# Linux LPIC-1: System Administrator

## Boot the System (bios, efi, sysvinit, systemd)

### The boot process

* System power on
* BIOS loads (or EFI/UEFI)
* MBR is read
* BIOS hands boot process to bootloader
* LILO/GRUB/GRUB2 Initial configuration of boot types / kernels
* LiNUX kernel is read and executed
* Devices are initialized, modules are loaded, initrd is loaded

* System is initialized
    //        ||       \\
systemd //// init /// upstart

#### sysvinit

init is the first process that runs in your system, it is the 'parent' of everythin running on the system.
it starts by the kernel after the boot loader starts the boot process.

##### start-up process
----------------

* the 'init' program is loaded (and becomes the first process (PID 1, /sbin/init)
* /etc/inittab is read and appropriate runlevel script(s) are run
* Modules indicated within the init scripts are loaded
* Root filesystem is checked
* Remaining local filesystems are mounted
* Network devices are started
* Remote filesystems are mounted (if configured)
* 'init' rescans /etc/inittab and changes or sets the system to the default runlevel
* runlevel scripts are executed by numeric order (S01 --> S99local)
* TTY sessions are loaded (if listed in /etc/inittab)
* System login prompt is displayed

##### SYSVINIT Runlevels
------------------
0 - HALT
1 - Single-user(Rescue shell)
2 - Multi-User(no networking or remote filesystems)
3 - Full Multi-User(including networking and remote filesystems)
4 - Custom user defined
5 - X11 (full multi-user with graphical desktop environment)
6 - Reboot

##### INIT Scripts
------------
located in:
!!!!! /etc/init.d/rc (debian)
!!!!! /etc/init.d/rc.d or /etc/rc.d (RHEL)
structure:
'S(1..99)(name)' (Example: 'S11auditd')
the init script is sa soft link to
a service script like so:
'S10network -> ../init.d/network'

kill scripts are the same except they start with a 'K'

init scripts are run in numerical order
when 'init' sets up the runlevel

* 'S99local -> ../rc.local' start script always runs last


##### Commands
--------
runlevel - shows runlevel
telinit - change runlevels
init - change runlevels


#### Systemd

systemd is an initialization system for bootstrapping
the user space and managing all process sybsequent to system start.

Was made to fix alot of the problems
in sysvinit, now used in almost every
linux distribution.

systemd is more efficient, allows parallel operations, has fewer dependencies,
 allows for service prioritization and precedence and reduces startup time.

##### start-up process
----------------

* Systemd runs
* Default run target is executed (along with dependencies)
* Modules indicated within runlevel target are loaded
* Remaining local filesystems are mounted
* Network devices are started
* remote filesystems are started
* systemd sets the runlevel as indicated by the default target
* System login prompt is displayed on console

##### SYSTEMD Runlevels
-----------------------

0 - poweroff.target (SHUTDOWN)
1 - rescue.target (Singer User/Rescue Shell)
2 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
3 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
4 - multi-user.target (Non-Graphical, Full Network, Multi-User)
5 - graphical.target (Graphical Desktop, Multi-User)
6 - reboot.target (Reboot)

##### SYSTEMD Scripts
---------------------

location:
/usr/lib/systemd/system/

'default.target' is the default runlevel, it is a symlink
pointing to on1e of the 7 target files that are associated with the system runlevels
'default.target -> graphical.target'

every script contains the following text:

==============

[Unit]
Description=Multi-User System
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=basic.target
Wants=sockets.target timers.target paths.target slices.target
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
AllowIsolate=yes

=============

'Require=' - requires current target to be this value to load this target file
'Wants=' - will load those targets/service files when it finishes loading
'Conflicts=' - will not load of those target/service files are loaded
'After=' - those target/service files can be loaded after this unit finishes loading

##### SYSTEMD Commands
----------------------

systemctl isolate multi-user.target --> change runlevel to specified target
systemctl set-default multi-user.target --> change default runlevel to specified target
systemctl get-default --> show default runlevel
systemctl list-units --type=target --> shows all available targets
systemctl reboot --> reboots the system
systemctl poweroff --> shuts down the system
systemctl halt --> halts the system

##### Shutdown / Reboot commands
--------------------------------

reboot --> reboots the system
shutdown -h --> "power-off" or halts the system
shutdown -P --> halts and then shuts down the system (if you have acpi)
shutdown -r (time) --> restarts the system
shutdown -r 30 -k "the system is shuttind gown" --> send a fake shutdown messege to all users, does not actually shut down the system
shutdown -c --> cancel the shutdown
halt (-w for faking it) --> halts the system
