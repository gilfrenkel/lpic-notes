### GRUB Legacy / GRUB2 

#### GRUB Legacy

GRUB Legacy is a bootloader, stands for GRand Unified Bootloader.
It was created to deal with the issues the older LILO bootloader had.

On boot, after BIOS hands the boot process to the bootloader
a menu will appear, listing the available boot options
for different kernels and configurations.
typically the top one will be the most updated.

Pressing "e" on one of the menu entries will allow you to
choose a line from the entry to edit

Pressing "a" will allow you to append an argument to the kernel line
and "c" will drop you to grub command shell, while in edit mode "o" / "O" to add new line

##### GRUB and bootloader related files

In /boot we will find several important files

vmlinux-(version) - the kernel image
initrd-(version) - the init ram disk image
config-(version) - configuration parameters specific to kernel version
messeges - kernel messeges
symvers-(version) - compressed module listing compiled for the kernel

we will also find the grub folder,
in there we will find the stage files, used by grub to boot
and the menu.lst / grub.conf
which will have the grub configuration and menu entries


/boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
default=0
timeout=5

title  Arch Linux Stock Kernel
    root   (hd0,0)
    kernel /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda2 ro
    initrd /initramfs-linux.img

title  Arch Linux Stock Kernel Fallback
    root   (hd0,0)
    kernel /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda2 ro
    initrd /initramfs-linux-fallback.img
```

here we can change the grub default configuration and add/edit entries
