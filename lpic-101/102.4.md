# Linux LPIC-1: System Administrator

## Linux installation and Package management

### Debian Package management

There are different utilities used within the debian distribution
to manage and install packages, both locally and from remote repositories.
Since ubuntu and ubuntu derivatives are based on debian, we will
see the APT(Advanced Package Tool) and the DPKG tool used by both.
